The steps I followed to begin the analysis:

1. Download the individual CSV documents (I had 12 files for each month fo the year).
2. Import each into separate tables.
3. Combine them all into one table.
4. Inspect the data for any anomolies/ items that need to be cleaned up.
5. Identify and exclude data with anomalies
6. Create some queries for data visualisation.

// combining data into one table

drop table Trips_Data;

create table Trips_Data as
(select *
from trips_Jan

union

select *
from trips_Feb
union

select *
from trips_Mar
union

select *
from trips_Apr
union

select *
from trips_May
union

select *
from trips_Jun
union

select *
from trips_Jul
union

select *
from trips_Aug
union

select *
from trips_Sep
union

select *
from trips_Oct
union

select *
from trips_Nov
