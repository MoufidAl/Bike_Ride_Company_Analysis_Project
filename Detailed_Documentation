#In this stage of the cleaning process, I decided to make sure I have all the CSV files provided 
#combined into one file to make the analysis process accurate and smooth. 

#Before we begin, we need to call the libraries we are planning on utilizing in the project.
#(assuming all packages are already installed)

library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)

#At this stage, we are ready to import our data and assign newer names to the files if necessary. 
#since the activity falls in one year, I have decided to rename the files according to the month for easier reference.

# since I am working in R, I know that I can't combine these files if they have different column attributes. 
#for example if in certain months column X had some character values (strings) when it should be integer across all months in that column. 
# R wont be able to combine them so we need to make sure we clean the data and adjust it accordingly. 

#This step can be done quickly as well using SQL per the below: 

Create table Trips_Data AS 
(Select*
 From
  202101-divvy-tripdata.csv
 Union.
    .
 This step to be repeated for each month.
