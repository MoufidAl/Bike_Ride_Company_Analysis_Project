#In this stage of the cleaning process, I decided to make sure I have all the CSV files provided 
#combined into one file to make the analysis process accurate and smooth. 

#Before we begin, we need to call the libraries we are planning on utilizing in the project.
#(assuming all packages are already installed)

library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)

#At this stage, we are ready to import our data and assign newer names to the files if necessary.
