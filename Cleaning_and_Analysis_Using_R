# tools to be utilized in this project.

```{r}
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)
```

# import data and assign easier names.
# since all acitivity falls in one year, I named files according to the month for easier reference.
```{r}
trips_Jan <- read.csv('202101-divvy-tripdata.csv')
trips_Feb <- read.csv('202102-divvy-tripdata.csv')
trips_Mar <- read.csv('202103-divvy-tripdata.csv')
trips_Apr <- read.csv('202104-divvy-tripdata.csv')
trips_May <- read.csv('202105-divvy-tripdata.csv')
trips_Jun <- read.csv('202106-divvy-tripdata.csv')
trips_Jul <- read.csv('202107-divvy-tripdata.csv')
trips_Aug <- read.csv('202108-divvy-tripdata.csv')
trips_Sep <- read.csv('202109-divvy-tripdata.csv')
trips_Oct <- read.csv('202110-divvy-tripdata.csv')
trips_Nov <- read.csv('202111-divvy-tripdata.csv')
trips_Dec <- read.csv('202112-divvy-tripdata.csv')
```
# Viewing the data briefly using Colnames or head: 

```{r}
head(trips_Jan)
head(trips_Feb)
head(trips_Mar)
head(trips_Apr)
head(trips_May)
head(trips_Jun)
head(trips_Jul)
head(trips_Aug)
head(trips_Sep)
head(trips_Oct)
head(trips_Nov)
head(trips_Dec)
```
# or 

colnames(trips_Jan) ...etc

# but we also should look at the entire dataset. using View (preferably for each month):

View(trips_Jan)...etc

# Since we have 12 different files, it would be highly impractical to do analysis on each file and therefore,
  our goal is to integrate the data into one large file so we can perform analysis and visualizations.

# Therefore, we need make sure all the columns have matching data attributes (type of data) in each file. 
# we can do this manually by using the str function: 

```{r}
str(trips_Jan)
str(trips_Feb)
str(trips_Mar)
str(trips_Apr)
str(trips_May)
str(trips_Jun)
str(trips_Jul)
str(trips_Aug)
str(trips_Sep)
str(trips_Oct)
str(trips_Nov)
str(trips_Dec)
```

# or 

Have R do it for us by using the the compare_df_cols function: 

```{r}
compare_df_cols(trips_Jan, trips_Feb, trips_Mar, trips_Apr, trips_May, trips_Jun, trips_Jul, trips_Aug, trips_Sep, trips_Oct, trips_Nov, trips_Dec, return = "mismatch")
```

# The function confirmed no anomolies or discrepancies in data types. 

# combine files: 

```{r}
trips_2021 <- bind_rows(trips_Jan, trips_Feb, trips_Mar, trips_Apr, trips_May, trips_Jun, trips_Jul, trips_Aug, trips_Sep, trips_Oct, trips_Nov, trips_Dec)
```

# to take a look at the massive file: 

```{r}
View(trips_2021)
```
The result is a very large file with over 5M entries.
