# Google_Certificate_Project
The capstone project for the Professional Google Data Analytics Certificate Program

*Stage One*

In stage one of the process, I will be planning the best tools to utilize in this project and breaking down the request / task of the of the case study.

**The Scenario**

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, I need to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

**Goal/Objective/Deliverable**

I will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

The data is provided through the company's internal dataset and made available by Motivate International Inc. the data consists of 12 months of bike_ride activities from January of 2020 to January of 2021. 


**Limitations on the project** 

prohibited from using riders' personally identifiable information:I won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.

*Stage Two*

In this stage, I will be looking at the data , verifiying its integrity, downloading and storing it secuirly, and get a sense of how the data is organized. 
this stage is very important before starting the cleaing and analysis processees to acquire a strong grip on the task at hand and the resources available.
