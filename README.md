# Google_Certificate_Project
The capstone project for the Professional Google Data Analytics Certificate Program

-- In this stage, I will be planning the best tools to utilize in this project and breaking down the request / task of the project

**The Scenario **

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, I need to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

**Goal/Objective/Deliverable**

I will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

The data is provided through the company's internal dataset. the data consists of 12 months of bike_ride activities from January of 2020 to January of 2021.
