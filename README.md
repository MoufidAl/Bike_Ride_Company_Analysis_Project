# Google_Certificate_Project
The capstone project for the Professional Google Data Analytics Certificate Program

**Stage One - Preparation**

In stage one of the process, I will be breaking down the request / task of the of the case study and any limitations I have before starting to work.

**The Scenario**

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, I need to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

**Goal/Objective/Deliverable**

I will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

The data is provided through the company's internal dataset and made available by Motivate International Inc. the data consists of 12 months of bike_ride activities from January of 2021 to December of 2021 


**Limitations on the project** 

prohibited from using riders' personally identifiable information:I won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.

**Stage Two - Processing**

In this stage, I will be looking at the data , verifiying its integrity, downloading and storing it secuirly, and get a sense of how the data is organized. 
this stage is very important before starting the cleaing and analysis processees to acquire a strong grip on the task at hand and the resources available to utilize. 

The goal in this stage is to check the data for errors, choosing the right tools, transform the data to work on it effectively, and document the cleaning process

I have chosen to use R to review the data, clean it, and prepare it for analysis. 
more details can be found in the code document.


**Stage Three - Descriptive Analysis and Visualization** 

I have utilized R for some basic descreptive analysis and visualization and then used Tableau to create more insight. 
(linke for tableau is available here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/moufid.alsaig#!/?newProfile=&activeTab=0 ) 

**Stage Four - Conclusions and Recommendations** 
In progress - the project is still missing a final presenatation and more visualizations to carry the analysis to fruition.
